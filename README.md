This project is a recreation of a landing page design by The Odin Project using flexbox to get more familiar with the different aspects of html, css, flexbox, and how they're used in the development of webpages. 

The div elements are nested in different ways to create the different sections of the webpage. Flexbox is then used to position the divs in specific ways to make each section unique.
